# 4s4r (art group)

(Lat. Phosphorus; Rus. Фосфор, 2009, Moscow), is a media artists group founded in 2009 by Alex Platonov, Mic Sachkov and Alexei Orlov (2010). The main point of the group strategy did not cooperate with alcohol, tobaco brands (and the state structures untill 2017 Davos Sberbank) [1]. Beginning in 2010, after joining of Alexei Orlov the group holds several events known as the “Bring Your Own Beamer” [2] to make up for the lack of communication in a professional environment of Moscow in the first years of existence [3].
